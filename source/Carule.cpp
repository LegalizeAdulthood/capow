/* 2017  To build, open Carule.sln with Visual Studio's Visual C++ 2015.  Make sure you are
building the Release x96 version. Your target *.DLL file
will apear in the DLL subdirectory of the code directory. To change the name of the DLL
output, in Visual C++ 2015 with the Carule.sln open, go to View | Solution Explorer, right click on Carule, select
Properties, and do two things:
(1) Go to Configuration | General | Target Name and change it to, like, MyNewRule
(2) Go to Linker | General, and edit the name in the top Output File line to, like, MyNewRule.DLL
If you only do step (2) the file will still build, but you'll get some warnings.
If this is too much trouble, externally change the name in the output DLL directory after the build.  */

/* Usage

	Define a CA rule using the data names defined in carule.hpp.  It is
handy to keep all of your past rules in this file and simply comment in
exactly one of the #define statements to pick one rule.  A good way to
make a new rule is to look at a similar rule found in this sample code, block
copy that code, and alter it. 
	Sometimes if you keep changing the rules, you get compiler errors like this:
error C2084: function 'void __cdecl USERINITIALIZE(class CA *)' already has a body
You can make this error go away by using the "Rebuild All" option instead of
the "Build" option.  If the message still doesn't go away it means you have
two blocks of code with the same #ifdef label, so two version of your functions
are getting compiled.

	By default the CARule.sln project will build a new rule called
New User Rule.dll  It will be in the dll subdirectory of the source code
directory. When you have the rule working the way you like, you can right click on it
in Windows Explorer and change its name.
	Alternately, you can change the name of your output *.DLL by editing the 
Project Output File name by using the Solution Explorer. Right click on Carule, select
Properties to get the to Project Settings dialog. Change the target file name in two places
(1) Configuration Properties | General | Target.  Put the file name with no .dll extenstion
(2) Configureation Properties | Linker | Output File. Put file name with .dll extension.

	If you try and build a *.DLL while the a *.DLL of the same name has
been selected into a running session of CAPOW, you will get this error message
at link time.
"The DLL you are linking is in use by another application.  The link will be
 aborted."
	To avoid this you must terminate close down the CAPOW session OR use a
different name for the *.DLL you are building.

Writing LAMBDA for (DT^2/DX^2), we get
NewC = -PastC + 2*(1 - LAMBDA)C + LAMBDA*(L + R)
Note that if PastC, L,C,R are all the same size S, then the expression is
-S + 2*(1-LAMBDA)*S + 2*LAMBDA*S, or -S + 2*S, or S.  The LAMBDA serves
as a weight.  We can think of it as (1-LAMBDA)(C+C) + LAMBDA(L+R).
If I take LAMBDA bigger than 1, then we get bogus values.  That's why
DT must be less than DX.  If I take, say, LAMBDA to be 1/2 I'd get
-PAST_C_I0 + C_I0 + 0.5*(L_I0 + R_I0);  [CARULE_WAVE_AVG_1]
If I were to take LAMBDA to be 2/3, I'd get

-PAST_C_I0 + (2.0/3.0)*(L_I0 + C_I0 + R_I0); [CARULE_WAVE_AVG_2]
We can compile these as CARULE_WAVE_AVG_1 and CARULE_WAVE_AVG_2.
It turns out that version 1 is quite stable, while version 2 is quite
unstable.

#ifdef CARULE_2D_ACTIVATOR_INHIBITOR
/*	This is a two-dimensional activator-inhibitor rule.
C_I0 is the activator substance a and C_I1 is the inhibitor or antagonist b.
The reaction works like A -> 2A + B, autocatalyzed in a nonlinear fashion by
the presence of A, and inhibited by B.  The equations I base this in are 2.1
in Hans Meinhardt "The Algorithmic Beauty of Seashells" (Springer 1995), p. 23.
Meinhardt gives two equations based on the following parameters:
	a	The concentration of the activator substance.
	b	The conentration of the inhibitor substance.
	Da	Diffusion rate of the activator.
	Db	Diffusion rate of the inhibitor.
	ba	The basic spontaneous activator production rate.
	ba	The basic spontaneous activator production rate.
	ra	The activator removal rate.
	ra	The activator removal rate.
	s	The source density, akin to the reaction rate.
	Min_b The mininum value of b.
The equations Meinhard gives are:
	da/dt = s * (a*a/b + ba) - ra*a + Da*d2a/dx2		(Eqn. 2.1.a)
	db/dt = s*a*a + bb -rb*b + Db*d2b/dx2			(Eqn. 2.1.b)
	Looking in his SP.BAS program, which runs this rule for one-dimensional CAs,
	we see that he computes the new values as
	New_a = a - ra*a + Da*(TwoSum_a - 2*a) + s*(a*a/b + ba)
	New_b = b - ra*b + Db*(TwoSum_b - 2*b) + s*a*a + bb
	We write "TwoSum_a" to mean the sum of the a values in the left and right
	neighbors, and "TwoSum_b" has a similar meaning.
Here are some comments on the terms.
	Da, Db.  For stable pattern formation, Db should be at least 7 times as large
		as Da.  The inhibitor, in other words, should disperse rapidly so that
		a local maximum of the activator can be stable.  The inhibitor makes a
		a ring of inhibition around it.  When you have a very broad activated
		region, the inhibitor can't escape fast enough, and there will be a hole
		in the middle of the region caused by the inhibitor killing off the
		activator.  For oscillating Zhabotinsky style reactions, on the other
		hand, it seems good to have Da and Db about the same size, or maybe
		Da only four times as big as Db.  In any case, very low values on the
		order of 0.01 for Da and Db keep the rule from evolving too rapidly and
		jerkily.  More about how we use Da and Db is below in the remark on
		diffusion.
	ba, aa.  Meinhardt says ba is so the system can regenerate itself and insert
		new maxima in blank areas, and he says bb is useful for travelling waves.
	ra, rb.  Note that these terms are multiplied times, respectively, -a and -b.
		The idea here is that this is a proportional die-off rate.  If, eg.,
		you have a population of 100 people, you might get 1 death, but with 
		a population of 1000 people you'd expect 10 deaths.  The idea here is
		that we are thinking of the a and b values as populations of molecules
		within the cell.
	s.       Meinhardt suggests that for stable patterns we set s equal to ra,
		so that the expected value of a is about 1.  That is, if a and b are
		roughly equal and ba is negligible, Eqn. 2.1.a would reduce to
		da/dt = s*a - ra*a + diffusion, so if s = ra, then we get a da/dt 
		consisting only of a diffusion.  For oscillating rules, however,
		we prefer to have s be 1.0.
	Min_b     Since we divide by b in the activator equation, we want to avoid
		dividing by 0.  We do this here by not replacing the divisor term by
		Min_b whenever the inhibitor value b is less than Min_b. Note that if
		Min_b is small, then the reaction gets a big boost whenever the
		inhibitor drops down, as dividing by Min_b is a big multiplication. 
		Note that we do allow b to drop to 0.0, we just don't divide by 0.
Comments on diffusion term Da*d2a/dx2.
		We're going to follow Meinhardt and ignore dt and dx in this rule, 
	essentially assuming that they are unity.
		The most obvious thing to do is to set Da*d2a/dx2 to Da*(EightSum - 8*a),
	where EightSum is the sum of the a values in the eight neighbor cells.  This will
	be numerically unstable if Da is greater than 1/8 or 0.125, as then a positive-a
	cell surrounded by zero-a cells would become negative, so we could enforce Da
	(and Db) to be less than 0.125.
		Actually, it's a bit better to use Da*(FourSum + 0.75*CornerSum - 7*a). 
	The idea is to weight the corner cells a bit less.  I come up with 0.75 because
	it's convenient (because 0.75*4=3) and because the area of a quarter circle
	is PI/4 the area of the enclosing square, adn PI/4 is close to 0.75.  In this
	case we need to clamp Da and Db to be less than 1/7, or 0.14.
		In converting Meinhardt's 1-D rules to our 2-D rules, we can use all of his
	parameters the same except for his diffusion parameters.  Our raw 2D difference
	term is roughly 7 times the difference between two cells, while in 1D the
	raw difference is 2 times the difference.  So in translating from Meinhardt,
	we multiply his diffusion paramters by a factor of 2/7.  Normally the rule
	is not highly sensitive to the  diffusion value so I in fact simply convert
	Meinhardt's diffusion values by multiplying by a factor of 1/4.

#ifdef CARULE_2D_ACTIVATOR_INHIBITOR_5
/*	This is a two-dimensional activator-inhibitor rule with 5 neighbors,
instead of with nine, like CARULE_2D_ACTIVATOR_INHIBITOR just above.
C_I0 is the activator substance a and C_I1 is the inhibitor or antagonist b.
The reaction works like A -> 2A + B, autocatalyzed in a nonlinear fashion by
the presence of A, and inhibited by B.  The equations I base this in are 2.1
in Hans Meinhardt "The Algorithmic Beauty of Seashells" (Springer 1995), p. 23.
Meinhardt gives two equations based on the following parameters:
	a	The concentration of the activator substance.
	b	The conentration of the inhibitor substance.
	Da	Diffusion rate of the activator.
	Db	Diffusion rate of the inhibitor.
	ba	The basic spontaneous activator production rate.
	ba	The basic spontaneous activator production rate.
	ra	The activator removal rate.
	ra	The activator removal rate.
	s	The source density, akin to the reaction rate.
	Min_b The mininum value of b.
The equations Meinhard gives are:
	da/dt = s * (a*a/b + ba) - ra*a + Da*d2a/dx2		(Eqn. 2.1.a)
	db/dt = s*a*a + bb -rb*b + Db*d2b/dx2			(Eqn. 2.1.b)
	Looking in his SP.BAS program, which runs this rule for one-dimensional CAs,
	we see that he computes the new values as
	New_a = a - ra*a + Da*(TwoSum_a - 2*a) + s*(a*a/b + ba)
	New_b = b - ra*b + Db*(TwoSum_b - 2*b) + s*a*a + bb
	We write "TwoSum_a" to mean the sum of the a values in the left and right
	neighbors, and "TwoSum_b" has a similar meaning.
Here are some comments on the terms.
	Da, Db.  For stable pattern formation, Db should be at least 7 times as large
		as Da.  The inhibitor, in other words, should disperse rapidly so that
		a local maximum of the activator can be stable.  The inhibitor makes a
		a ring of inhibition around it.  When you have a very broad activated
		region, the inhibitor can't escape fast enough, and there will be a hole
		in the middle of the region caused by the inhibitor killing off the
		activator.  For oscillating Zhabotinsky style reactions, on the other
		hand, it seems good to have Da and Db about the same size, or maybe
		Da only four times as big as Db.  In any case, very low values on the
		order of 0.01 for Da and Db keep the rule from evolving too rapidly and
		jerkily.  More about how we use Da and Db is below in the remark on
		diffusion.
	ba, aa.  Meinhardt says ba is so the system can regenerate itself and insert
		new maxima in blank areas, and he says bb is useful for travelling waves.
	ra, rb.  Note that these terms are multiplied times, respectively, -a and -b.
		The idea here is that this is a proportional die-off rate.  If, eg.,
		you have a population of 100 people, you might get 1 death, but with 
		a population of 1000 people you'd expect 10 deaths.  The idea here is
		that we are thinking of the a and b values as populations of molecules
		within the cell.
	s.       Meinhardt suggests that for stable patterns we set s equal to ra,
		so that the expected value of a is about 1.  That is, if a and b are
		roughly equal and ba is negligible, Eqn. 2.1.a would reduce to
		da/dt = s*a - ra*a + diffusion, so if s = ra, then we get a da/dt 
		consisting only of a diffusion.  For oscillating rules, however,
		we prefer to have s be 1.0.
	Min_b     Since we divide by b in the activator equation, we want to avoid
		dividing by 0.  We do this here by not replacing the divisor term by
		Min_b whenever the inhibitor value b is less than Min_b. Note that if
		Min_b is small, then the reaction gets a big boost whenever the
		inhibitor drops down, as dividing by Min_b is a big multiplication. 
		Note that we do allow b to drop to 0.0, we just don't divide by 0.
Comments on diffusion term Da*d2a/dx2.
		We're going to follow Meinhardt and ignore dt and dx in this rule, 
	essentially assuming that they are unity.
		The most obvious thing to do is to set Da*d2a/dx2 to Da*(FourSum - 4*a),
	where FourSum is the sum of the a values in the four neighbor cells.  This will
	be numerically unstable if Da is greater than 1/4 or 0.25, as then a positive-a
	cell surrounded by zero-a cells would become negative, so we could enforce Da
	(and Db) to be less than 0.25.
		In converting Meinhardt's 1-D rules to our 2-D rules, we can use all of his
	parameters the same except for his diffusion parameters.  Our raw 2D difference
	term is roughly 4 times the difference between two cells, while in 1D the
	raw difference is 2 times the difference.  So in translating from Meinhardt,
	we multiply his diffusion paramters by a factor of 1/2.

		within the cell.

		roughly equal and ba is negligible, Eqn. 2.1.a would reduce to
		da/dt = s*a - ra*a + diffusion, so if s = ra, then we get a da/dt 
		consisting only of a diffusion.  For oscillating rules, however,
		we prefer to have s be 1.0.
	sb		Since we divide by b, we don't want to divide by 0.  We'll
		avoid this by always adding sb to the b term in the denominator.
		This correction is called the "Michaelis-Menten term for finite
		activator production at low inhibitor concentration," and is 
		introduced in Meinhardt, p. 42.
	sa      The saturation of activator production parameter.  This is supposed to
		allows larger larger regions of activator to form because the activator
		can only get up to a certain value.  The rule is VERY sensitive to this,
		a value of 0.00001 is often plenty.
Comments on diffusion term Da*d2a/dx2.
		We're going to follow Meinhardt and ignore dt and dx in this rule, 
	essentially assuming that they are unity.
		The most obvious thing to do is to set Da*d2a/dx2 to Da*(EightSum - 8*a),
	where EightSum is the sum of the a values in the eight neighbor cells.  This will
	be numerically unstable if Da is greater than 1/8 or 0.125, as then a positive-a
	cell surrounded by zero-a cells would become negative, so we could enforce Da
	(and Db) to be less than 0.125.
		Actually, it's a bit better to use Da*(FourSum + 0.75*CornerSum - 7*a). 
	The idea is to weight the corner cells a bit less.  I come up with 0.75 because
	it's convenient (because 0.75*4=3) and because the area of a quarter circle
	is PI/4 the area of the enclosing square, adn PI/4 is close to 0.75.  In this
	case we need to clamp Da and Db to be less than 1/7, or 0.14.
		In converting Meinhardt's 1-D rules to our 2-D rules, we can use all of his
	parameters the same except for his diffusion parameters.  Our raw 2D difference
	term is roughly 7 times the difference between two cells, while in 1D the
	raw difference is 2 times the difference.  So in translating from Meinhardt,
	we multiply his diffusion paramters by a factor of 2/7.  Normally the rule
	is not highly sensitive to the  diffusion value so I in fact simply convert
	Meinhardt's diffusion values by multiplying by a factor of 1/4.

		da/dt = s*a - ra*a + diffusion, so if s = ra, then we get a da/dt 
		consisting only of a diffusion.  For oscillating rules, however,
		we prefer to have s be 1.0.
	sb		Since we divide by b, we don't want to divide by 0.  We'll
		avoid this by always adding sb to the b term in the denominator.
		This correction is called the "Michaelis-Menten term for finite
		activator production at low inhibitor concentration," and is 
		introduced in Meinhardt, p. 42.
	sa      The saturation of activator production parameter.  This is supposed to
		allows larger larger regions of activator to form because the activator
		can only get up to a certain value.
Comments on diffusion term Da*d2a/dx2.
		We're going to follow Meinhardt and ignore dt and dx in this rule, 
		essentially assuming that they are unity.
		The most obvious thing to do is to set Da*d2a/dx2 to Da*(EightSum - 8*a),
	where EightSum is the sum of the a values in the eight neighbor cells.  This will
	be numerically unstable if Da is greater than 1/8 or 0.125, as then a positive-a
	cell surrounded by zero-a cells would become negative, so we could enforce Da
	(and Db) to be less than 0.125.
		Actually, it's a bit better to use Da*(FourSum + 0.75*CornerSum - 7*a). 
	The idea is to weight the corner cells a bit less.  I come up with 0.75 because
	it's convenient (because 0.75*4=3) and because the area of a quarter circle
	is PI/4 the area of the enclosing square, adn PI/4 is close to 0.75.  In this
	case we need to clamp Da and Db to be less than 1/7, or 0.14.
		In converting Meinhardt's 1-D rules to our 2-D rules, we can use all of his
	parameters the same except for his diffusion parameters.  Our raw 2D difference
	term is roughly 7 times the difference between two cells, while in 1D the
	raw difference is 2 times the difference.  So in translating from Meinhardt,
	we multiply his diffusion paramters by a factor of 2/7.  Normally the rule
	is not highly sensitive to the  diffusion value so I in fact simply convert
	Meinhardt's diffusion values by multiplying by a factor of 1/4.

/* Instead of using velocity, we can avoid it.  The principle is this:
Normally a 2D Wave motion is
(1) NewC = -P + 2C + dt^2/dx^2 (FOURSUM/4 - C);
[And 1D is exactly the same with (L+R - C) as the last term.]
I had been handling a force F by donig an acceleration of F/mass.
(2) NewV = V + dt*F + dt/dx^2 (FOURSUM/4 - C);
(3) NewC = C + dt*NewV.
But in 2D I don't have a velocity field in the cell that I can count on as
being initialized to 0.  So I've been faking it using the variable[1] field.
Which sometimes has garbage.  But I don't really need V.  Instead I can replace
V by (C - P)/dt in (2), and then substitute the new V-less expression for NewV
in equation (3), getting
(4) NewC = 2*C - P + (dt^2/mass) F + dt^2/dx^2(FOURSUM/4 - C)

/*	This is based on Winfree's paper. Arthur T. Winfree, "Rotating 
Chemical Reactions", Scientific American, June 1974, pp. 82-95.
We think of our 0 plane as holding an activator A, and the 1 plane
as holding an inhibitor B.  Winfree's rule is to set an inhibitor
growth rate K, an activator growth rate L, and an activator threshold T.
We get these dynamics:
dB/dt = K*A
dA/dt = - L*(A+B) if A < T
cA/dt = L*(1-(A+B)) if A > T
We can discretize these rules as follows.  
newB = B + K*A
newA = A -L*(A+B) if A < T
newA = A +L*(1-(A+B) if A >= T
Now, we also need to include diffusion.  The scheme I like to use is
to first carry out the diffusion, then to run the update rules on 
the diffused values, and then to put the diffused values into the cells.
That is, we compute Aaverage and Baverage, and use these equations
newB = Baverage + K*Aaverage
newA = Aaverage -L*(Aaverage+Baverage) if Aaverage < T
newA = Aaverage +L*(1-(Aaverage+Baverage) if Aaverage >= T
