/* The Borland stdlib.h defines long rotate left and long rotate right
functions called _lrotr and _lrotl.  We need to call _lrotr(x,1) and
_lrotl(x,1) in the thirtytwobits function. The Borland stdlib.h also
defines rotate left and rotate right functions called _rotr and _rotl.
 We need to call _rotr(x,1) and_rotl(x,1) in sixteenbits.
 If your compiler's stdlib.h doesn't have these functions, you can
 define similar macro functions yourself as by commenting in the line
#define MYMACROS above. */

/* This is a set of randomizing functions written by Rudy Rucker,
rucker@mathcs.sjsu.edu.  The randomizing algorithm used is based on
the one-dimensional cellular automaton called Rule 30.  Stephen Wolfram
discovered that this rule makes a good randomizer, see his paper on
the subject in his anthology, Theory and Applications of Cellular
Automata, World Scientific, 1986.  See also Wolfram's Patent #4,691,291
on this rule, and be warned that use of Rule 30 as a randomizer may
be in violation of the patent.  By way of mitigation of this warning,
do note that Rucker has significantly altered the randomizer by adding
the "count" register, and that Rucker wishes to place the so-modified
Wolfram-Rucker randomizer in the public domain. */

/* Since the random code works with register variables, it makes a
difference whether the registers are 16 bit or 32 bit.  When you do
a 32 bit build, the constant __FLAT__ is defined.  Note that __FLAT__ has
two underscores before and after.  We write two versions of most of the
functions in random.cpp, and have a big switch on __FLAT__ to choose the
appropriate block of code.  The "derived" second-order functions that
don't have calls to sixteenbit or thirtytwobit are at the end, and are
the same for the two memory models. */
