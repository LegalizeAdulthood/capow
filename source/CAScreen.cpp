		This screensaver was written by Rudy Rucker.
		It is based on a screensaver downloaded as part of the freesave.exe
	"Complete Windows Package" from
	http://www.escape.ca/~bbuckels/freesave.htm 
		Buckels says this:
	    "If you use this code as the basis for your own screen saver, you
    should not have much trouble adapting it, but be careful to read
    the comments in scrnsave.h and perhaps the bouncer project and
    don't remove any of the code that Windows expects.
	    "A screensaver is only an EXE file that is produced using certain
    specific guidelines, and then renamed to a .SCR file. In Windows 3.1 
	these are kept in the Windows directory and in Windows 95 they are tossed
	into the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. They then become visible in the Control
	Panel and run exactly the same as the Microsoft-shipped screensavers."
	---Bill Buckels 1997
		Things Rudy has learned about screensavers:
	* You have to include <scrnsave.h> and link to SCRNSAVE.LIB.  There are some
		helpful comments in the scrnsave.h, which lives in your compiler's
		Include directory.
	* A screensaver does its painting in the WM_ERASEBKGND message.  It MUST NOT
		process WM_PAINT.
	* A screensaver procedure must be called ScreenSaverProc, a screensave
		initialization dialog procedure must be called ScreenSaverConfigureDialog
		and the dialog resource must be called DLG_SCRNSAVECONFIGURE.
	* As well as defining a ScreenSaverProc and a ScreenSaverConfigureDialog,
		you must also define a (trivial) RegisterDialogClasses function
		which just returns TRUE.
	* The running of the initialziation dialog and the screensaver are distinct.  
		The only way to save info from the dialog is into a profile string (easy)
		or into the Windows Registry using HKEY_USERS, RegSetValueEx, RegEnumValue,
		and RegQueryValue (don't know how to do yet, it looks gnarly.)  And you
		load the info out of the profile string at start of dialog or screensaver.
	* Use a WM_TIMER message to keep the screensaver running.  Don't worry, by the
		way, about too many WM_TIMER messages, as only one from a given timer is
		put in the queue at the same time.  You don't have access to the message
		loop for a screensaver in any case, so there is no  hope of using	
		a "Peekmessage else" or an "OnIdle" technique.
	* The scrnsave.h file defines an szAppName variable with the awkward type
		char [APPNAMEBUFFERLEN] instead of char *.  You must assign a value to
		this variable in your screensaver code.  You should not try and
		access this variable in other modules as it's not practical to try
		and reference a fixed-size buffer.  It's a poor team player and should
		not be included in any group activities.  Define it here, but don't
		use it anywhere.  Let it sulk alone.  Then define a char * szMyAppname
		which you can easily reference in other modules.  If you had a
		szAppName in your main .EXE module, change that to a szMyAppame for
		consistency.
	* scrensave.h also prototypes
		a function called RegisterDialogClasses.  You must provide a body for
		this function in your screensaver code.
	* For accessing your window, you can use the fact that scrensave.h defines
		an HINSTANCE hMainInstance and an HWND hMainWindow.  I think maybe the
		screensaver likes you to declare these in here as externs even if you
		don't use them.
	* The modal screen dialog closes with the default OK button press when you
		press enter, so you need to convert your editbox text to numbers here.

The SCRNSAVE.LIB also uses TCHAR instead of char, but since this isn't a Unicode application that
doesn't make any difference, as TCHAR has a default typedef of char.  The bad
thing about this variable is that if you try and reference it externally as
an extern TCHAR szAppName * this doesn't work.  So don't use it anywhere else.
